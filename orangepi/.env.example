# Standard MQTT port is 1883 (unencrypted) or 8883 (encrypted)
MQTT_PORT=1883
# Authentication credentials for the MQTT broker
MQTT_USERNAME=your_username
MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password
# Topic where doorbell detection events will be published
MQTT_TOPIC=alarma/detector
# Unique client ID for this Orange Pi instance
MQTT_CLIENT_ID=orangepi_doorbell_detector

# Audio Configuration
# ------------------
# Index of the audio input device (run `python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"` to find yours)
AUDIO_DEVICE_INDEX=2
# Audio sampling rate in Hz (standard is 44100)
SAMPLE_RATE=44100
# Number of audio channels (1 for mono, 2 for stereo)
CHANNELS=1
# Chunk size for audio processing
CHUNK_SIZE=4096
# Amplitude threshold for audio processing (higher values filter more background noise)
AMPLITUDE_THRESHOLD=2300
# Duration of audio buffer in seconds
BUFFER_DURATION=1.0

# Model Configuration
# ------------------
# Path to the trained TensorFlow model file
MODEL_PATH=/opt/doorbell_detector/models/doorbell_model.h5
# Threshold for doorbell detection (0.0 to 1.0, higher values require more confidence)
DETECTION_THRESHOLD=0.5
# Number of consecutive detections required to trigger an alert
CONSECUTIVE_DETECTIONS=2
# Cooldown period in seconds between alerts to prevent rapid triggering
COOLDOWN_PERIOD=10

# Debug Configuration
# ------------------
# Set to true to save audio fragments for debugging
