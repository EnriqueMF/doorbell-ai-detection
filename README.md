[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üìã Overview

This project develops an AI-powered system that captures and analyzes audio to detect a specific doorbell sound. Using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and machine learning techniques, the system can discriminate the target doorbell from ambient noise, even in noisy environments.

When the doorbell is detected, the system sends an alert through an MQTT broker to connected devices, allowing for flexible notification options including mobile notifications via Telegram.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture


The system consists of several key components:

1. **Audio Capture & Processing (Orange Pi Zero3)**
   - Captures real-time audio via connected microphone
   - Runs the trained ML model for doorbell detection
   - Publishes detection events to MQTT broker


2. **MQTT Message Broker with VPS Server or local implementation (with Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, etc.)**
   - Core communication hub - system will not function without this
   - Handles message routing between components
   - Maintains connection state and message delivery
   - Provides secure communication channel

3. **Alert System (ESP8266)**
   - Subscribes to doorbell detection events
   - Triggers MP3 playback through connected speaker
   - Sends instant notifications to your Telegram account
   - Allows remote control via Telegram commands


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Required MQTT Server Setup

**IMPORTANT**: A running MQTT broker is REQUIRED for this system to function. The MQTT broker acts as the central communication hub between all components. Without a properly configured MQTT server, the system will not work.

You have several options for setting up an MQTT broker:

1. **VPS Server** (Recommended):
   - Set up a VPS with your preferred provider (DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.)
   - Install and configure Mosquitto MQTT broker
   - Ensure the server is accessible from your network
   - Configure proper security (firewall rules, authentication)

2. **Local Server**:
   - Set up Mosquitto on a local machine (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, desktop computer)
   - Must be always running and accessible on your network
   - Configure port forwarding if remote access is needed

3. **Public MQTT Broker** (Not recommended for production):
   - Only use for testing
   - No guaranteed uptime or security
   - Limited functionality

For detailed MQTT server setup instructions, refer to the [VPS MQTT Server Configuration Guide](vps/README.md).

#### Hardware Requirements

- Orange Pi Zero3 with Ubuntu installed
- ESP8266 development board (NodeMCU or similar)
- DFPlayer Mini MP3 module (for audio playback)
- VPS server or local system for MQTT broker
- USB microphone
- Speaker (8ohm recommended)
- Python 3.8+

### Installation

**IMPORTANT**: Before proceeding with any component installation, ensure you have a running MQTT broker. The system cannot function without it.

Detailed installation instructions are available for each component:

- [VPS MQTT Server Configuration](vps/README.md) (Start here - REQUIRED)
- [Orange Pi Zero3 Setup](orangepi/README.md)
- [ESP8266 Alert System Setup](esp8266/README.md)

### Security and Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration (MQTT credentials, server addresses, etc.) following security best practices:

- All sensitive information is stored in `.env` files which are not committed to the repository
- Example configuration templates are provided as `.env.example` files
- The setup scripts check for existing configuration files before prompting for new values
- Permissions on credential files are automatically set to be readable only by the owner

When deploying this system, make sure to:
1. Never commit `.env` files with real credentials to version control
2. Keep backups of your configuration in a secure location
3. Use strong, unique passwords for all services

## üìä Model Training

The audio detection model is trained using various samples of the target doorbell sound recorded under different conditions:
- Different distances from the doorbell
- Various background noise levels
- Different times of day/environmental conditions

The training process is documented in Jupyter notebooks in the `model_training/` directory. We provide a Makefile that facilitates setting up the environment using conda for better dependency management.

## üîß Hardware Requirements

For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting, see [VPS MQTT Server Configuration](vps/README.md).

## üß† ML Model Architecture

The doorbell detection system uses a neural network model trained on audio features:
- Spectral contrast (energy concentration across frequency bands)
- MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
- Chroma features (12 semitone pitch classes)

The model is designed to be lightweight enough to run on the Orange Pi while maintaining high accuracy.



## Technical Analysis: EM-200 Doorbell Audio Characteristics

This project focuses on detecting a specific doorbell model (EM-200) by analyzing its unique acoustic signature.

### Spectral Analysis

The EM-200 doorbell produces a distinctive sound pattern with unique frequency characteristics:

![Doorbell Spectrogram](docs/images/espectrograma_timbre.png)

* **Constant component**: Sustained power at 1 kHz
* **Alternating components**: Deterministic activity at 1.4 kHz and 1.6 kHz
* **Distinctive temporal pattern**: The 1600 Hz frequency exhibits a pulse pattern with:
  - 130 ms activation
  - 70 ms attenuation
  - Cyclic repetition while the button is pressed

This temporal pattern can be clearly observed in the following graph:

![Power Variation Over Time](docs/images/variaci√≥n_potencia.png)

### Feature Extraction Approach

Our detection algorithm extracts multiple audio features optimized for this specific doorbell's acoustic signature:

#### 1. Mel Spectrogram (n_mels=40)

```python
mel_spec = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=y, sr=sr, n_mels=40, n_fft=1024, hop_length=512)
```

**Why n_mels=40?** 
- Optimal resolution for capturing the key frequencies of the EM-200 (1, 1.4, and 1.6 kHz)
- The 40 bands provide sufficient detail of the energy distribution without generating excessively large feature vectors
- Allows differentiation of the 1.4 kHz and 1.6 kHz components that are critical for identification

#### 2. MFCC Coefficients (n_mfcc=20)

```python
mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(S=librosa.power_to_db(mel_spec), n_mfcc=20)
```

**Why n_mfcc=20?**
- The first 13 coefficients capture the general shape of the spectrum
- Coefficients 14-20 capture the fine details needed to identify the characteristic oscillations between 1.4 and 1.6 kHz
- Temporal derivatives (delta) are also included to detect the 130ms/70ms pulse pattern

#### 3. FFT Window and Overlap (n_fft=1024, hop_length=512)

**Why these values?**
- At a 16 kHz sampling rate, n_fft=1024 provides a resolution of ~15.6 Hz per bin
- This resolution is critical for precisely differentiating between the 1.4 kHz and 1.6 kHz components
- The 50% overlap (hop_length=512) allows for accurate tracking of the 130ms/70ms temporal pattern

#### 4. Spectral Contrast (n_bands=6)

```python
spectral_contrast = librosa.feature.spectral_contrast(y=y, sr=sr, n_bands=6)
```

**Why n_bands=6?**
- Allows analysis of the difference between peaks and valleys across the spectrum
- Bands 2-3 specifically capture the 1-2 kHz region where the EM-200 doorbell has its main components
- Highly effective for distinguishing the doorbell (with defined tonal components) from diffuse ambient noises

### Advantages of Our Approach

Our multi-feature approach significantly outperforms simple frequency analysis methods:

| Aspect | Simple FFT Analysis | Our Multi-Feature Approach |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Noise robustness | Low | High |
| False positives | Frequent | Greatly reduced (<1%) |
| Sensitivity | Requires high volume | Works with low volume |
| Adaptability | Only for EM-200 | Adaptable to variations |

### Performance Metrics

- **Detection accuracy**: >98% in environments with moderate ambient noise
- **False positives**: <1% in 24-hour tests with various household noises
- **Detection latency**: <300ms from the start of the sound

This specialized audio analysis forms the foundation of our doorbell detection system, enabling reliable operation even in challenging acoustic environments.
